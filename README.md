# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
This project focuses on developing an advanced handwritten digit recognition system using neural networks. The system is built to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset and extends its functionality by incorporating a graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time digit entry and recognition
